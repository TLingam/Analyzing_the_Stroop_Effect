# Analyzing_the_Stroop_Effect
In this analysis, I try to prove that participants in a Stroop test take longer at Incongruent tasks. 


## Introduction
The Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task. When the name of a color (e.g., "blue", "green", or "red") is printed in a color that is not denoted by the name (e.g., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color.


## Stroop Test
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink.
The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed.
The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition.
In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed.
In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed.
In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists.
Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.


## Why does the Stroop Effect happen?

As habitual readers, we encounter and comprehend words on a regular basis. The reading occurs almost effortlessly, whereas declaration of a color requires more cognitive effort. 
When there is a conflict between these two sources of information, cognitive load is increased, and our brain has to work harder to resolve the required difference. 
Performing these tasks (preventing reading, processing word color, and resolving information conflict) ultimately slows down our responses, and makes the task take longer. 
There are a few theories explaining the cause of Stroop effect. The popular ones emphasize the automaticity of reading and the mental prioritizing that we perform when reading as the primary cause of Stroop interference.
